	This is a collection of programs I made for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. Below is a list detailing each cpp file explaining what they do (and what problem they solve). 	
	Project 1: A program that asks what data you want to add to a linked list. I had to modify this one to allow characters and strings.
	Project 2: A program that converts a number entered in as a string into an actual integer or double value, using a stack.
	Project 3: A program that determines whatever word you input is a palindrome or not using both a stack and a queue.
	Project 4: A program that fills an array with the size of 10000 with random integers and sorts it all using quick sort. (Uses the searchAndSortAlgorithms header file)
	Project 5: A program that allows the user to fill a binary tree with data, and shows the height, number of nodes, number of single parent nodes, and the postorder traversal of the binary tree. (Uses the binaryTree.h file)
	Project 6: A program that uses a STL link list to find the students with the highest GPA, as given by the HighestGPAData.txt file.
	Project 7: A program that, using data from the data.txt file, creates a graph and shows the weight and the breadth first traversal of the graph.
